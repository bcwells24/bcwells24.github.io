## Artifact

The artifact selected for enhancements in the areas of Software Deisgn and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases is an Android mobile application developed at SNHU in the CS360 class, which was centered around Mobile Architecture and Programming. The intent of the application was to track inventory items, with the app centered around having a main data table visible to the user and give the user the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions within the application, altering the data in the database. An additional requirement of this application was to send an SMS notification to the userâ€™s phone number when any inventory item in the database reached a stock level of zero. This application was created in 2024 for the course and was progressively built with robust planning, User Interface design, and coding functionality into the application with Java. The original application can be seen here:
